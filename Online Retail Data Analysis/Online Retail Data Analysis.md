# Online Retail Dashboard (2011) Analysis

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to analyze online retail sales data for the year 2011, uncovering patterns in customer behavior, product demand, and revenue trends. Using Power BI, an interactive dashboard was developed to support decision-making by visualizing sales by country, time of day, month, and quarter.

## Data Acquisition and Preparation
The dataset was sourced from a retail transaction file containing details such as:

 - Invoice Date

 - Customer ID

 - Country

 - Quantity

 - Total Sales

The data was loaded into Power BI Desktop for cleaning, modeling, and visualization

## Data Cleaning

The raw dataset required preprocessing to ensure accuracy:

 - Removed missing or blank CustomerID entries.

 - Excluded cancelled transactions (negative or zero quantities).

 - Standardized column names (e.g., InvoiceDate - Date, Total_sales).

 - Filtered out the United Kingdom, as requested, to focus on international sales.

 - All necessary data cleaning and preparation were performed in MySQL before importing into Power BI for visualization.
